# Easy-NLP-Trainer

This is a tool made to help teams annotate their machine learning datasets quickly. All you have to do is populate the database with your CSV file and then open localhost:3000 to start annotating! There is also a flask server for taking remote input for the machine learning software.

Make a database with postgres and add your dataset to the table.
Then start the servers and you can begin annotating.

# To start rails, rails s

# To start flask, flask run

# To start the react development server, cd into client and npm start
